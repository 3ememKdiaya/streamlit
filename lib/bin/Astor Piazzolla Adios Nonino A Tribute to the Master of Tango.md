One of his most famous and beloved compositions is Adios Nonino, a poignant and emotional piece that he wrote in 1959 as a farewell to his father, who had died suddenly while Piazzolla was on tour in Central America. The title means "Goodbye Grandfather" in Lunfardo, a slang dialect of Buenos Aires. The piece is considered a masterpiece of tango nuevo, a style that Piazzolla pioneered with his use of complex harmonies, counterpoint, polyrhythms and extended forms.
  
Adios Nonino has been recorded by numerous artists in various arrangements and interpretations, from solo piano to symphony orchestra. It has also been used in films, television shows, ballets and musicals, such as the Broadway hit Forever Tango. In 2012, a compilation album titled Astor Piazzolla - Adios Nonino was released, featuring 13 versions of the piece by different performers, including Al Di Meola, AnÃ­bal Troilo, Athos Bassissi, Claire Le Boulanger, Classic Jam Quartet, Klaudiusz Baran, Luz y Sombra, MÃ¡ximo Pujol, Norma Rossi, Daniel Erni, Raul Jaurena Trio, Roberto Bravo, Tandem and Tango Argentino.
